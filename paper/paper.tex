\section{Summary}\label{summary}

The multiphonon python package calculates a phonon density of states from
inelastic neutron scattering (see, for example \cite{FultzINSbook})
spectrum from a powder sample. The algorithm is a self-consistent,
iterative procedure that finishes when
the measured spectrum can be accounted for by
the one-phonon scattering, multi-phonon scattering, and multiple
scattering from the deduced phonon density of states, under the
incoherent approximation (Appendix of \cite{KreschNickel2007} and
Section 6.5 ``Calculation of Multiphonon Scattering'' of
\cite{FultzINSbook}).
