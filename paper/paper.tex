\section{Summary}\label{summary}

multiphonon is a python package that calculates phonon density of states
from inelastic neutron scattering (see, for example \cite{FultzINSbook})
spectrum from a powder sample. The algorithm is a self-consistent
iterative procedure that finishes when
the measured spectrum can be accounted for by
the one-phonon scattering, multi-phonon scattering, and multiple
scattering from the deduced phonon density of states, assuming
incoherent approximation (Appendix of \cite{KreschNickel2007} and
Section 6.5 ``Calculation of Multiphonon Scattering'' of
\cite{FultzINSbook}).
