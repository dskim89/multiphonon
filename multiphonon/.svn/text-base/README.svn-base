NEEDED FIXES:

!!! Create top level documentation !!!
-- use Matt's as a guide ?

- Straight line for elastic cutoff
  - fix the error bars for this.

-  the internal representation of C_ms should match the paper 

Double and triple check expSqe.expand and expSqe.slopeCut.  
Fix up causes of warnings:
  Warning: divide by zero encountered in divide
  Warning: invalid value encountered in divide
  -- You can "GetDos.py 2>/dev/null"

Plotting:
  - What about gnuplot compiled with zlib instead of libgd?
  - Perhaps there should be a separate conf file for plotting stuff?
    - is putting the GDCONF stuff in user.py too ugly??

Clean out some of the test cases?
